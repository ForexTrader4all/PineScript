Use code with caution.

This Python script creates a simple guessing game for kids. Here's how it works:

Imports the random module: This module is used to generate a random number for the game.
Defines the funny_game() function: This function contains the logic for the game.
Prints a welcome message: Welcomes the player to the game.
Gets the player's name: Asks the player for their name.
Generates a random number: Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
Gives the player 3 chances to guess the number:
Asks the player to guess a number.
Compares the player's guess to the secret number.
If the guess is correct, the player wins.
If the guess is incorrect, the player is given feedback (too low or too high) and can try again.
Reveals the secret number (if necessary): If the player didn't guess the number, the secret number is revealed.
Prints a thank you message: Thanks the player for playing.
Calls the funny_game() function: The function is called to start the game.
This script can be easily customized to add more features or make it more challenging. For example, you could add more levels, give the player more chances to guess, or make the secret number range larger.
